      <h2>Gametalk</h2>

      <p>
        In corporate-tech America, a lot of conversation focuses on video games. Much of this discussion is rooted in fraternal notions of tribe and masculinity, and it persists even at companies praised for gender equailty.

        Many multiplayer video games have been a known refuge for sexist behavior and male aggression. Women who play them are subjected to verbal abuse, and feminists who provide commentary on video games are harassed, hacked, even subjected to threats of rape and dismemberment.

        Players in these games are typically anonymized as strong male characters with superhuman powers and stamina. This sense of strength provides a psychological space in which gamers feel secure engaging in antisocial and misogynistic behaviors.

        Many tech workers do not directly perpetuate in-game sexist behavior, but they are oblivious to what their vocal enthusiasm for games signifies to the people around them.

        Videogames are an expensive, addictive hobby. Advancements in the industry continue to drive up the price as well as the addictive quality of the gaming experience. Withdrawal from extended immersion in V/R, has been dubbed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/post-vr-sadness/511232/]">post-VR sadness</a>.  Isn't this a symptom of videogaming in general?

      <p>
        There is a growing alternative gaming community, making both games and virtual spaces where mysogyny and racism are rejected, but it's not enough to give me hope that havens of white male supremacist thought will persist in videogames for a long time.
