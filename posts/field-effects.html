      <h2>Field Effects</h2>

      <p>
        A physical field is the assignment of a physical quantity at each point in space at a given time. For instance, the weather is an assignment of wind, temperature, and precipitation conditions at points on the earth's surface. Sometimes, given a field, we can abstract away a scalar value. This process is called dimensional reduction. For instance, given the vibrations of molecules in space, we can arrive at a temperature. Given the folds in a piece of paper, we arrive at its crumpledness. These scalars, which represent a property of the field, are called collective variables.

        I am curious how well these abstractions apply to human society. Given the frequency of certain types of interactions between a group of people, can we calculate their sense of community as a collective variable? For instance, in the same way that I have a feeling for temperature, I have a feeling for community in my neighborhood - it is something I sense, although it is not attributable to an individual actor. Perhaps we can think of the emotional health of a group as a variable that emerges from interactions (aggressions / kindnesses) between individuals. What other social qualities can be extracted from group interactions? And what symmetries can we deduce from the resulting fields?

        And what criteria can we use to select proxies / original quantities that determine the collective variable? Imagine using the frequency of exclusive language (ingroup status declarations, etc...) to measure the inclusivity of a specific online forum. Is the frequency of exclusive language a good enough fit to determine a value like inclusivity?
