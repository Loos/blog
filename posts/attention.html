      <h2>Attention</h2>

      <p>
        As a child I loved magic tricks, and worked to learn a few techniques of prestidigitation. Although I read that the real act is the management of attention and misdirection, the significance of that didn't sink in at first. I am still rarely able to use 'magic' to delight an audience; when I have it has been mostly by accident. But each time I've succeeded, I am reminded of the truth of that magic is about misdirection and attention management.

        A story of failure will help illustrate my point. A teammate of mine was given a 'magic wand' - a plastic tube filled with glitter and some liquid. To prove that it was magic, I performed a trick, disappearing a money clip with a french drop. I had no followup and my teammates were confused and somewhat angry. They did not understand what had happened, but there was no closure and they felt fooled. It is not enough to showcase the technique; this gives the audience nothing to engage. There is nothing to transform their confusion into the delight that it could become.

        An example where I fared a bit better occurred at a campsite with a pitbull named Big Momma. Big Momma wanted a hardboiled egg I was eating, and I wondered if she would fall for the same trick. I palmed it, and Big Momma's focus remained on my empty hand. When I revealed the egg was gone, Big Momma's consternation was obvious. She sniffed my hand and began sniffing the ground in confusion. The onlookers laughed - this poor pitbull, the unlucky object of my trick, was the catalyst needed to transform their surprise into delight. Her confusion proxied theirs, giving them some psychological distance from the fact that they too were fooled. Because they had this emotional proxy, they were sufficiently removed from their own confusion to enjoy themselves.

        Attention misdirection extends to camouflage too - a naive conception of camouflage might equate it with blending in, but a broader and more pragmatic view should encompass ways to direct the target's attention away from what needs to be hidden (a feature common in nature, as with the butterfly family Satyrinae).

        Attention manipulation isn't just a feature (or defect?) of animal intelligence, either. As machines become increasingly intelligent, they too become succeptible to attention manipulation - image classifiers are fooled by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf">adversarial patches</a> and facial recognition software can be fooled by <a href="https://ahprojects.com/projects/hyperface/">designs which have been trained to be recognizable as faces</a>. I believe this nascent field of machine attention is really interesting, and I'm excited to see future developments.
